This is a Fast CGI module for perl. It's based on the FCGI module
that comes with Open Market's FastCGI Developer's Kit, but does
not require you to recompile perl.

It even no longer requires perl to be compiled with sfio.
To compile with sfio you'll need at least perl 5.003_02 and you'll have
to have configured it with eg './Configure -Duseperlio -Dusesfio'.
(See the INSTALL file that comes with the perl distribution.)
To compile without sfio you'll need an even more recent perl version.
(perl 5.004 and up should be fine.)

See http://www.fastcgi.com/ for more information about fastcgi.
Lincoln D. Stein's perl CGI module also contains some information
about fastcgi programming.

See echo.fpl for an example on how to use this module.

To install, do the usual

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

If you want to use the (experimental) pure perl version, that
doesn't require a compiler and currently only works on Unix,
you have to pass the --pure-perl option as in
"perl Makefile.PL --pure-perl".

Note that the pure version does not support Window's Named Pipes.
Support for Named Pipes is not a requirement of the FastCGI specification.
Named Pipes are used by mod_fastcgi and the FastCGI application library as a
replacement for Unix sockets.  mod_fastcgi uses Named Pipes on Windows (Unix
sockets on Unix) by default (see the mod_fastcgi docs for more information).

If you want the module to use a previously installed fcgi library
instead of the included files, use the --use-installed option,
optionally followed by the name of the directory in which it can 
be found.

To configure the library Makefile.PL will run ./configure .
You may want to run it yourself beforehand because its findings
may not always be correct.
The configure.readme file describes how to run ./configure (and only that).

If you're on a solaris system and your installed fcgi library is 2.02b
or earlier, you'll probably want to use the included files.

The old interface of the FCGI module installs die and warn 
handlers that merely print the error/warning to STDERR (the 
default handlers print directly to stderr, which isn't redirected 
in the non sfio case). I'm not very happy with the result. 
Suggestions welcome.
