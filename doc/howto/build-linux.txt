Ubuntu 18.04 build dependencies:
sudo apt install git cmake libssl-dev libogg-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev libsdl2-dev liblzo2-dev libjpeg-dev libncurses5-dev

Build commands:
------
cd xray-16
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir bin && cd bin
cmake ..
(or export CC=clang && export CXX=clang++ && cmake ..)
make


Build:
------
To build X-Ray Engine you'll need following libraries:
* OpenSSL: https://www.openssl.org/source
  - Prebuilt binaries can be downloaded here: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
* OpenAutomate: https://developer.nvidia.com/openautomate
* NVAPI: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvapi
* libjpeg: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg
  - Use "jpeg" as project root directory name for compatibility with CxImage
* zlib: http://zlib.net
* BugTrap: https://github.com/nitrocaster/BugTrap
* FreeImage: http://freeimage.sourceforge.net
* FreeMagic
* libogg-1.1.4: http://xiph.org/downloads
* libtheora-1.1.1: http://xiph.org/downloads
* libvorbis-1.2.3: http://xiph.org/downloads
* Autodesk Maya 2008/2009 SDK
* Autodesk 3DS Max 6.0 SDK
* Windows SDK: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
* DirectX SDK June 2010: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812
  - replace dxguid.lib with the one from Windows SDK
    (for DirectPlay GUIDs)
XXX nitrocaster: add LuaJIT & LuaBind instructions

You can download all these libraries (except Windows/DirectX SDK) with compiled binaries here:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2mH6ffKfXjCMjRfRTZsVlBtUVE

Setup:
------
- Install S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat
- Install patch 1.6.02 (only for russian locale, worldwide release should have it included):
  http://cop.stalker-game.ru/?page=patches#2
- Download and unpack archive with libraries
- Run xrbinprep.cmd to initialize new game binary directories and link default gamedata to OpenXRay's:
  $ xrbinprep.cmd "C:\Program Files (x86)\GSC World Publishing\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - Call of Pripyat"
  Note that this script requires admin rights (in order to execute 'mklink'). Also make sure you pass a
  game installation directory to this script. Once done, you can find .xrbinup_xxx scripts in the reporitory root:
  use them later to install newly built binaries to the corresponding game binary directory.
- Now you can build the engine!
