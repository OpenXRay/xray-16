Setup:
------
- Install S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat using wine.
For example if you have a cd-rom you can type `wine setup.exe` to start installation. 
It's recommended do not use path with spaces, for instance you can use "c:\cop" as 
an installation path (it will be `~/.wine/drive_c/cop` path on your host linux machine).
- Install patch 1.6.02 (only for russian locale, worldwide release should have it included):
  http://cop.stalker-game.ru/?page=patches#2

After building in the engine folder do (assuming you installed CoP in "c:\cop"):
```
mkdir ~/.wine/drive_c/cop/bin-linux-dbg # here will be installed binaries with dbg symbols
make DESTDIR=~/.wine/drive_c/cop/bin-linux-dbg install
cd ~/.wine/drive_c/cop/bin-linux-dbg
```
if you want to debug the game you need to prevent input grabbing:
```
setxkbmap -option grab:break_actions 
```
now you can run the game using 
```
./xr_3da.sh -fsltx ../fsgame.ltx
```
or if you want to debug using gdb:
```
DEBUGGER="gdb --ex=r --args" ./xr_3da.sh -fsltx ../fsgame.ltx
```
