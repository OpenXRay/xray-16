TITLE: X-Ray 1.6 build and setup instructions

Build:
------
Currently, the only compiler supported is Visual C++ 2017. If you don't have Visual Studio yet, you can
download and install Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition - it's absolutely free for open source projects.

By default, all libraries mentioned below (except Windows SDK) are assumed to be in
the src\Externals directory.

Windows SDK is available from Visual Studio 2017 installer. You will definitely need to install the following items:
* Windows 8.1 SDK (or newer)
* Visual C++ MFC for x86 and x64
* NuGet package manager

You will need following extension to save files in Visual Studio with encoding UTF-8 without BOM:
