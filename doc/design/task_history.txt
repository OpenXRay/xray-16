TITLE: X-Ray Engine 1.6 task history

--------------------------------

nitrocaster: Pavel Kovalenko
+ get rid of STLPort
+ bugs
  + fix lights_hanging_lamp class name in system.ltx (used 'SO_HLAMP', should be 'O_HLAMP')  
  + core
    + xrMemory::mem_usage -> mem_usage_impl falls into infinite loop or finds bad nodes
    + stackoverflow when game directory contains too many files (_alloca)
    + buffer overflow when copying command line to Core.Params
  + render
    + dx10StateUtils::ValidateState(D3D_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC&) doesn't initialize passed D3D_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC with
      proper default values when DepthEnable flag is false. Because of this incorrect initialization previously created
      state cannot be found, so renderer creates it over and over.
