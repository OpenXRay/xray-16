[![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/OpenXRay/xray-16.svg?label=Contributors)](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/graphs/contributors)

Join our efforts in making our beloved game better, send pull requests, participate in discussions and code reviews!

It is a place to share ideas on what to implement, gather people that want to work on the engine,
and work on the source code. However, the following things should be taken into consideration:

* We want to keep the game as close as possible to the vanilla game, so instead of introducing new gameplay features,
  consider adding non-gameplay features, fixing bugs, improving performance and code quality.
* Major changes should be discussed before implementation.
* Follow the [procedures](doc/procedure).

Take a look at our [Issues](https://github.com/openxray/xray-16/issues) page:
* See issues labeled as [good first issue](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22) to get familiar with the engine code in practice.
* You may also want to look at issues labeled as [help wanted](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Help+wanted%22). Some of them are difficult ones, though.

The `dev` branch is the default and base branch for the project. It is used for development and all Pull Requests should go there. But, be aware that this branch, sometimes, may be broken and, rarely, we can do force pushes to this branch.

Be advised that this is a community project not sanctioned by GSC Game World in any way – and they remain the copyright holders
of all the original source code and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. franchise. <br>
However, they know about many community projects, including this, and support the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. community efforts to make the game better.
