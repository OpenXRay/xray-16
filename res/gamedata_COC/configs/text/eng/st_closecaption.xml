		<text>Well, I propose a toast to a brave squad of Duty men, sent to the front lines for some serious green scum ass kicking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_main_2">
		<text>Have I told you the story about Flint? First he set up stalker hunters to get attacked by a chimera, then he left his partner to die in an anomaly and then he joined Freedom. I'd say that's a pretty logical conclusion right there. So, I'd say we drink to the hope that all members of Freedom follow his lead and we'll take care of whoever is left.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_main_3">
		<text>Let's drink to the fact that even in the center of the Zone there are people who are willing to serve Duty. To our new squad!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_main_4">
		<text>I raise my glass to the fact that this research complex is now fully protected by Duty from mutants, anarchists and other scum.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_main_5">
		<text>Fellows! Let's drink to honour our brave volunteers for taking readings in some of the Zone's most dangerous areas for the good of our scientific progress.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_main_6">
		<text>I propose a toast to Duty fighters who courageously fought off a cowardly attack made by those filthy punks.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_reaction_1">
		<text>Damn right!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_reaction_2">

	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_reply_1">
		<text>He's dead already. And if it were up to me I'd have all of you follow suit. Teach you to quit exporting the Zone's products outside driven by that same greed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_reply_2">
		<text>Nobody knows what really happened. It's not like you were there to see it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_reply_3">
		<text>Is that a squad made up of Monolith people? Well, I hope you'll find yourself a bloodsucker squad too, 'cause once you do, the Lieutenant Colonel will definitely add you to the list of dangerous mutants.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_reply_4">
		<text>Ha! Some guard you are. Just last year the Mercenaries had you running around the Dark Valley with your tail between your legs. Or have you forgotten?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_reply_5">
		<text>Yes, I can imagine the readings the scientists are getting. Air samples: 100% smoke, water samples: 100% vodka, and idiotic laughter on all sound frequencies.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_duty_reply_6">
		<text>That's all right. We'll get our weapons back. You guys have developed a nifty habit of dropping weapons and artefacts whenever you run into our fighters. I don't blame you either. Can't be easy holding at it, what, with your pants shat and all?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_main_1">
		<text>Boys! Have you heard how Duty is sticking to its traditions? Take Warrant Officer Morgan, in following the strict need to maintain his faction's reputation he thought it was his "duty" to sell off half his warehouse on the sight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_main_2">
		<text>Fall in! Remember? Duty's stalwart traditions were laid down by General Tkachenko himself. He lied to his comrades, misled the HQ and bravely died in a Space Bubble. Here's to all members of Duty following his lead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_main_3">
		<text>You know, the first time I saw our new squad I asked them, 'Fellows, would you prefer to join Duty instead? You're free to do as you like, after all.' You know, they said to me, 'No, thank you. With them it's all about the orders. To give, primarily. No wonder their eyes are empty. We've had enough of zombies.'</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_main_4">
		<text>A member of Duty came up to one of our people, got in the bunker and asked him, 'Professor, could you tell me which artefact is best for fighting boars? Wrenched to protect you from radiation, or Eye to help you with wounds.' Do you know what the answer was? 'Shell is what you need, son. If you see a boar, run back to your base as fast as you can.' Haha!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_main_5">
		<text>People, you know how the scientists came to choose our boys to take anomaly measurements? They actually went to see Shulga first and said to him, 'There's a job that needs doing for the benefit of science.' And he said, 'No problem. Who do I have to execute?'</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_main_6">
		<text>With every day that goes by the need for Duty becomes clearer to me. I mean, who else would put together a whole warehouse of weapons and ammo, and then donate it to Freedom? It was really nice of them, wouldn't you say?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_reaction_1">

		<text>[laughter]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_reply_1">
		<text>Yeah? Well, I seem to remember how your brave squad was on their knees groveling for access to Yanov before an emission.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_reply_2">
		<text>Everyone's got one of those. Duty is a real haven for hypocrites. 'We'll protect the world from the Zone', right after we collect a few artefacts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_reply_3">
		<text>Good deal. Fanatic should stick with fanatics. You should wear Monolith uniforms too. Lest stalkers might actually confuse you for humans.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_reply_4">
		<text>From mutants? You sure you'll have enough space in that bunker when the mutants come out in force? It's not like it's the 100 Rads bar. You can't just hole up there and wait it out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_reply_5">
		<text>If your volunteers drink as much as you do, I can only imagine the readings scientists are getting.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b221_freedom_reply_6">
		<text>Yeah, that's right. Bring in as many guards as you can. Now half the Zone knows about your equipment warehouse, so expect visitors.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_revage_senya">
		<text>Hold on...! Find him! Worst is yet... argh...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_artefact">
		<text>You should have seen me getting this one artefact the other day. That was something. You know anything about the Quarry? Well. Whatever decent shit there once was is long gone. There's no point looking in anomalies Flint has looked in. Everyone knows that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_bloodsucker">
		<text>I'll tell you everything there is to say about bloodsuckers. When I was at Zaton, those assholes made life real difficult for just about everyone. Stalkers kept at 'em day and night but it didn't help one bit. Poor bastards. One day I decided to help them out. So I took my shotgun and went straight for the bloodsucker lair. Three days I was partying with those sons of bitches, at times taking on two or even three together. After some quality time with yours truly the bloodsucker problem at Zaton is all but over. The bastards keep their tentacles tucked in at all times.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_controller">
		<text>Okay, I'll tell you how to kill controllers. The other day I chanced upon a buttload of artefacts and decided to stash them while still en route 'cause my back couldn't hack it any-more. On the way back I got to my stash and there it was, a controller, chilling right on top of it. Now I thought to myself, 'Controller or no controller, I got to get my shit back.' Then I realized that if I shield myself with something its manipulation bullshit won't work on me. So, I picked up a metal grate that I found lying around and started sneaking up on the beast. By the time it woke up to what was going on I pumped off a clip into the cocksucker's head. Just as it started trying to control me I gave it a final bash with my rifle butt and that was that.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_first_reac_1">
		<text>Ah! Now that's some story, Flint.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_first_reac_2">
		<text>Flint's a real man, that's for sure.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_first_reac_3">
		<text>Yeah... Not bad.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_guide">
		<text>Well, I'm sure you know about the path from Zaton... No? Well, the guide used to take a massive detour. What I did was create a shortcut by cutting across a straight line, a novel idea. I tried a few places and worked out the way through the anomalies pretty quick. So I sold that info to the guide and now he takes everyone that way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_oasis">
		<text>You heard about the Oasis? Of course you've heard of it. I, on the other hand, have actually been there. I was the first person to work out the way to get there, a pioneer if you will. There ain't no mutants or friggin' anomalies there. It's quiet as a graveyard and full of artefacts. I was there only a few days ago. Sunday, do you know that... Lead you there? Ha! Sorry, but I don't want it getting crowded. Nothing personal.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_scientist">
		<text>Well, I've got a lot of stories to tell. Did I tell you about my time working for the scientists? So, one day I go and pop in to their bunker, real curious to see what they're up to in there. At first they're all in shock. But then they go, 'You're exactly what we need right now.' It turns out they wanted to set up their devices under anomalies. Obviously the eggheads didn't feel like doing it themselves, so they promised me cash and other goodies. So I was like, 'Well, that's fine, but the goodies better be worth it!' I had to crawl around that area looking for anomalies but it wasn't half as hard as getting those nerds to fork up their award money.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_second_reac_1">
		<text>Cool story!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_second_reac_2">

	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_second_reac_3">
		<text>Wow!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="jup_b25_story_zaton">
		<text>There might be a few folk who think that Flint is telling lies. Well, they can ask anyone at the base about me. Even the squad of pro hunters, when they spotted me the other day they were all like, 'We need you, Flint. We can't do it without you.' They were hunting a chimera, so I had to show these "pros" how it's done. My ammo is real friggin' simple. I just head straight into the lair. They left one rookie by the entrance to keep an eye out for it. Of course, come morning, as soon as the newbie saw the beast he shat his pants and legged it, so I had to deal with it myself. Successfully, as you can see, he-he-he...</text>
