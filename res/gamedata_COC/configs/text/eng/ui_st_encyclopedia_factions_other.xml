			%c[guide_blue]Zombified%c[default] stalkers are those who have fallen under the effects of a strong psi-field.\n
			\n%c[guide_green]Information%c[default]
			\nThese creatures lack the higher functions of the brain and act solely on residual reflexes and skills, incapable of conscious activity, and having a high threshold for pain.\n
			\nThe mental and physical health of a zombified stalker will gradually deteriorate over time, eventually losing the last of their humanity, and becoming the mutant known as a zombie.\n
			\nUnlike the mutant however, zombified stalkers are capable of using weapons and tools, and are frequently seen working together in groups, or with soldiers of the Monolith.\n
