* Variable, dynamic geometry detail of scene
	- highly optimized for T&L hardware
	- doesn't modify vertex data - only rearrange indices 
* Colored, animated dynamic, per vertex lighting
	- Intelligent light sources selection & clipping
	- Makes possible more than 100 dynamic lights per frame at reasonable FPS-es
* Very impressive simulation of atmosphere effects like sky/clouds/suns
	- Of course it depends on art-designers skills but the bumped sky looks great :)
* Fast, full-accelerated by hardware "Hard Shadow" generating algorithm
	- Disadvantage: requires presents of 8 (or more) bits stencil buffer
	- Advantages: the most current hardware has already had it :)
* Table W-Fog & Z-Fog support
	- automatic rollback to emulation via vertex fogging if hardware doesn't support it.
* Intelligent use of triple buffering scheme
	- results in FPS-es increase on video boards which have enough memory to hold all buffers
* Motion compensation scheme
	- Hides many visual artifacts produced by FPS-es instability
* Light maps (shadow maps) and dynamic lightmaps
* Flare system
* Particle system
* Coronas and Lensflares
* Detail patch subsystem
* Shader script support
* Support for texture compression
* Support for hardware transformation and lighting 
* Hierarchical objects
* Support for Lightwave objects
* Bump mapping
* Environment mapping
	- Cubic environment mapping
	- Spherical environment mapping
* Reflections
	- Pre-rendered textured reflection simulation can be applied on any object or part of it 
		without any performance penalty
* Single-mesh skeleton animation
	- High-speed blended animation system capable of up to infinity number of bones interpolation & modulation
	- The first 256 bones blending will be accelerated by GPU (if it capable of doing such thing :)
* Portal-style, non-linear subdivision based visibility detection system
	- Optimized for T&L hardware in the way of grouping primitives to large-size batches
	- Greatly reduces overdraw - which is the main slowdown on even high-level video boards
* Antiportals
* Intelligent hardware state caching technology
* Dynamically generated textures
* OBB-style collision-detection system
	- Capable of ideal determining collisions between high-poly models in high-detailed world
* Powerful scripting
	- Full realization of C-language 
	- Only 6-8 times slower than real (x86) code
	- Enables fast AI development and almost infinite number of texturing effects
* The most important part of the mathematics is optimized for PIII SSE & K6/K7 3DNow instructions

* High quality HRTF-3D sound, accelerated by hardware if possible
* Low-penalty & "low-delay" reaction technology (about 1-3ms to start HRTF 3D Sound Source to play)
* Sound clipping and sound reflection
* High speed streaming sound decoding
	- Means playing MP3/MP2/WMA/ADPCM tracks with almost no penalty to performance
* Context relative multiple-mixed music streams
